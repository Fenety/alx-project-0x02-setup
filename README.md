Next.js Project Setup and Basics
This project is a comprehensive, hands-on guide to building a modern web application with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It serves as a practical introduction to creating a well-structured application from the ground up, covering essential concepts like routing, component creation, and API integration.

Whether you're new to Next.js or looking to solidify your understanding of best practices, this project provides a clear roadmap for developing a clean, maintainable, and scalable application.

🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will gain a practical understanding of:

Scaffolding: How to set up a new Next.js application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

Routing: Implementing basic page navigation using the Pages Router.

Component Design: Building modular and reusable components with TypeScript interfaces.

API Integration: Fetching and displaying data from external APIs.

Project Structure: Organizing your codebase following industry best practices.

State & Props: Managing component state and passing data via props.

Responsive UI: Creating responsive layouts and interactive elements.

🛠️ Requirements
To get started, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v16 or later)

npm or yarn package manager

Git and a GitHub account

A code editor (VS Code is recommended)

This project assumes you have a basic understanding of React, TypeScript, and HTML/CSS.

📁 Project Structure
The project is structured to promote organization and modularity. Key directories include:

│   ├── common/           # Generic components (Button, Card, Modal)
│   └── layout/           # Page layout components (Header)
├── interfaces/           # TypeScript interfaces for data models
├── pages/                # Next.js page files for routing
├── public/               # Static assets (images, fonts)

└── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript compiler options
💡 Best Practices
This project emphasizes several best practices to ensure a high-quality codebase:

Project Structure: Components are organized by their domain and purpose (common, layout), while interfaces are kept in a dedicated folder for easy access and reusability.

Component Design: Each component follows the Single Responsibility Principle, focusing on a single task. TypeScript interfaces are used to ensure strong typing for props.

Code Quality: ESLint is configured to enforce consistent code style and catch potential errors early. Clear, descriptive comments are encouraged.

Performance: The project demonstrates how to optimize API calls and structure data fetching for better performance.

Documentation: A clear README.md and descriptive component usage are key to maintaining the project.

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-project-0x02.git
Navigate into the project directory:

Bash

cd alx-project-0x02
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
# or
yarn install
Run the development server:

Bash

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

🧩 Implementation Guide
Follow these steps to build the project:

Set up the Next.js project with the required configurations for TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

Start with the fundamental components like Button.tsx and Card.tsx.

Implement more complex, interactive components such as PostModal.tsx and UserCard.tsx.

Create the Header.tsx component to handle navigation between pages.

Implement data fetching on pages like posts.tsx and users.tsx, using the JSONPlaceholder API as the data source.

Continuously test each component and page to ensure everything works as expected.

✨ Expected Outcomes
Upon completion, you will have a fully functional Next.js application that demonstrates:

Effective use of the Next.js framework.

Well-defined, reusable components with TypeScript.

Seamless routing and navigation.

Successful API integration to fetch and display dynamic data.

A clean, responsive, and well-organized codebase.
